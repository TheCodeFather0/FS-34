      <p class="description">
        Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˌtseːdəs ˈbɛnts, -dɛs -]
        ⓘ),[6][7] commonly referred to simply as Mercedes and occasionally as
        Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle brand that was founded
        in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a subsidiary of the Mercedes-Benz Group,
        established in 2019) is based in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg,
        Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG manufactures luxury vehicles and light
        commercial vehicles, all branded under the Mercedes-Benz name. From
        November 2019 onwards, the production of Mercedes-Benz-branded heavy
        commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) has been managed by Daimler
        Truck, which separated from the Mercedes-Benz Group to form an
        independent entity at the end of 2021.
